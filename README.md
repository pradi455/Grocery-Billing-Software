# Grocery-Billing-Software
This is a desktop-based Grocery Billing System built using Python (Tkinter) with a MySQL database. It allows the shop to select products from categories such as Oil, Rice, Dal, Wheat, and Sugar, add them to a cart, and generate customer bills. The system supports storing and retrieving sales data from the database, printing bills to Excel format.
